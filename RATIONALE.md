## Code of Conduct
Rather than attempting to re-invent the wheel, I did some research into various codes of conduct.
I find myself most in line with the GNU foundation's "Kind Communication Guidelines" which function as a code of conduct for discussions.
Superfluous lines were removed, and references to the GNU project were removed or changed to simply "this project" or "project".
