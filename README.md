## What our python program does
The program prompts the user for a name input and their favorite number. Then the program tells whether the number is prime or not, and whether the number is even or not.

## Requirements
Because the program is written in a Jupyter notebook, it is recommended that you open it via Jupyter. Please see [https://jupyter.org/](https://jupyter.org/) for more information.

## Contributing
If you wish to contribute to the project, simply make a pull request and we will review the code.

## Rationale
### License

### Code of Conduct
Rather than attempting to re-invent the wheel, I did some research into various codes of conduct.
I find myself most in line with the GNU foundation's "Kind Communication Guidelines" which function as a code of conduct for discussions.
Superfluous lines were removed, and references to the GNU project were removed or changed to simply "this project" or "project".
