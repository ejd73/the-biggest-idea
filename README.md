## What our python program does
The program prompts the user for a name input and their favorite number. Then the program tells whether the number is prime or not, and whether the number is even or not.

## Requirements
Because the program is written in a Jupyter notebook, it is recommended that you open it via Jupyter. Please see [https://jupyter.org/](https://jupyter.org/) for more information.
