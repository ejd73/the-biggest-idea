# Code of Conduct
## The Most Important Rule
Do unto others as you would have them do unto you
## Exclusion is counter to the ideals of Free Software
Nobody will be turned away. All contributions will be evaluated on the quality of the code, and nothing more.

That said, contributions must be made in good faith. Attempting to commit intentionally bad code that introduces vulnerabilities will be met first with a warning, with a second offense being grounds for a permanent contribution ban.
## Your contributions here, and nothing more
None of your actions outside of this repository will have any bearing on your status within the repository.
